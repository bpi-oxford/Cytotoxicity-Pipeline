# Example Data

This directory is intended to store example datasets for running and testing the pyCyto pipeline.

**Note:** Due to the potential size of microscopy datasets, files in this directory (e.g., `.tif`, `.zarr`) are managed using **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**.

## Obtaining the Data

1.  **Install Git LFS:** If you haven't already, install Git LFS on your system. Follow the instructions at [https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/). You typically only need to run `git lfs install` once per user account.
2.  **Clone/Pull:** When you clone this repository or pull updates, Git LFS should automatically download the actual data files.

If you encounter issues, ensure Git LFS is correctly installed and initialized (`git lfs install --system` might be needed).
